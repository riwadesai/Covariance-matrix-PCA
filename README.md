# Covariance-matrix-PCA
Consider a data matrix Xn√ók. Either you need to simulate it or use some real life datafile from internet.
(i) Compute the covariance matrix for X.
(ii) Compute top 3 principal components. Report the amount of variance explained by them.
(iii) Report top 3 principal component loading vectors and top 3 principal components.
